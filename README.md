# toy-in-rust
As an exercise, motivation to learn more about the rust language, writing a simulation and visualization of
the TOY virtual machine in Rust.  At this point, there is a working website; minimal: it loads a fixed program, 
the multiple program from the source, and supports single stepping, and an animation of running the code.
